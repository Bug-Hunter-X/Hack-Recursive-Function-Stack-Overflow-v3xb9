# Hack Recursive Function Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack: stack overflow errors in recursively defined functions.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number.  For large numbers, the depth of the recursion exceeds the stack's capacity, leading to a crash. The solution demonstrates how to fix this using iteration.
